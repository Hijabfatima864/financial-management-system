The Financial Management System (FMS) is designed to allow 
users to manage their financial accounts, conduct transactions 
(deposits, withdrawals, transfers), and generate reports for 
balance statements and transaction history. The system will rely 
on basic Data Structures in C++ to organize, store, and manage 
data efficiently. It will utilize Linked Lists to store user and 
account information, a Stack for transaction management, and a 
Queue for managing report requests. The system will provide 
users with functionalities like creating and deleting accounts, 
performing transactions, and generating detailed reports. 
Problems : 
1 ) Inefficient transaction processing 
2 ) Lack of real-time visibility into transaction status, balances, 
and settlements 
3 ) Increased risk of errors, delays, and non-security . 
SOLUTION: 
To address this problem, we propose a Financial Transaction 
Management System that utilizes basic data structures such as 
stacks, queues, linked lists, and arrays. 
Objectives: 
User Management:  
The system will allow users to create, update, and delete 
accounts. User data will be stored in a Linked List, providing an 
efficient and dynamic way to manage user records. 
Account Management:  
The system will enable users to create, update, and delete 
f
 inancial accounts (e.g., checking, savings, and credit card 
accounts). Account data will also be stored in a Linked List for 
efficient record manipulation. 
Transaction Management: 
The system will allow users to perform transactions like 
deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Transactions will be stored 
in a Stack in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order to keep track of the 
most recent transactions first. 
Report Generation:  
The system will generate financial reports, such as balance 
statements and transaction history. Report requests will be 
handled using a Queue, which will manage the order of requests 
and ensure the reports are generated sequentially.

 Key features: 
The Financial Management System (FMS) is designed to allow 
users to manage their financial accounts, conduct transactions 
(deposits, withdrawals, transfers), and generate reports for 
balance statements and transaction history. The system will rely 
on basic Data Structures in C++ to organize, store, and manage 
data efficiently. It will utilize Linked Lists to store user and 
account information, a Stack for transaction management, and a 
Queue for managing report requests. The system will provide 
users with functionalities like creating and deleting accounts, 
performing transactions, and generating detailed reports. 
Security: 
The system must ensure secure handling of financial data and 
user authentication, restricting access to only authorized users. 
Efficiency: 
The system should be able to handle multiple users, accounts, 
and transactions efficiently, especially when dealing with large 
datasets. 
Usability: 
The user interface should be simple and easy to navigate. It will 
provide a command-line interface to interact with the system for 
creating users, managing accounts, and generating reports. 
Scalability: 
The system should be able to scale to accommodate many 
users, accounts, transactions, and report requests over time. 
Conclusion: 
The Financial Management System will provide a comprehensive 
solution for managing user accounts, recording financial 
transactions, and generating reports, all through the use of  Data 
Structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. By 
implementing this system, users will be able to effectively 
manage their finances with ease, and the system's ability to 
handle dynamic data will make it scalable and efficient. 
This system will also introduce efficient data management 
principles, ensuring that account and transaction data is 
organized and processed in a systematic, user-friendly manner, 
providing an overall enhanced user experience.
